Task: Escape Room
To successfully complete the Escape Room task, we need to work together and ensure that everyone is aware of the task and is happy to participate. Communication is key, whether it's face-to-face or over the phone. We should anticipate potential problems, such as team members being absent due to illness or not having all the necessary resources.

Task: Plan and Research
To complete the Plan and Research task on time, we'll split into two groups: one to research and the other to plan. This approach ensures that we don't fall behind schedule and achieve the desired outcome. We should anticipate potential problems such as team members being absent and not being able to find the decipher sheets. If we encounter unexpected issues, we'll need to be flexible and adaptable to find a solution.

Task: Resources and Briefing
To prepare for the task, we'll need to gather resources such as a morse code decipher sheet and different colored post-it notes. Each team should have their set of notes, with each note representing a letter. In the event of team members being absent or unable to find the necessary resources, we'll split the work and write the required information on paper.
